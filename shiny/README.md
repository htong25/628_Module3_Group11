## Introduction
This is a webpage to provide basic information to bar owners in Madison about the reviews from yelp

## Contribution
- Shikun Liu: created and built the app
- Jiayi Xu: modified get_comparison() function and finalized the app

## Note
`app.R` contains our original work that analyze around 30,000 reviews and give feedback. 

However, due to the limit in the size of data when publishing Shiny, we had to limit our data to only the first 2000 reviews to work with. Therefore, our webpage is produced by `tiny.R`, and although p-values and histogram might not reflect the most accurate analysis, it shows the basic outline of our app and it will function perfectly if using full-size data.
